Please use the Poke API v2 to fetch an initial list of pokemons and its various properties.

Pagination should be available.

Upon selecting a pokemon from the initial list, the user should arrive at a 2nd list view displaying a further list of pokemons which can possibly evolve from the selected Pokemon. Please note this list is usually a multi-level nested list.
